# Bookstore Frontend

A modern, responsive bookstore frontend built with React and Vite. This project provides a user-friendly interface for browsing, searching, and managing a book catalog, leveraging Vite's fast development server and optimized build process for an efficient development experience.

## Features

* Browse and search books with a clean, intuitive UI
* Responsive design for seamless use on desktop and mobile
* Fast development and hot module replacement with Vite
* Built with React for dynamic and reusable components

## Tech Stack

* **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling for fast development and optimized builds
* **React Router (assumed)**: For client-side routing (based on the `routes/` folder)
* **CSS**: Custom styles via `index.css` (Tailwind CSS can be added for utility-first styling)
* **JavaScript (ES Modules)**: Modern JavaScript syntax for clean code

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v16 or higher)
* npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bookstore-frontend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd bookstore-frontend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to view the app. Vite's hot module replacement ensures instant updates during development.

The optimized output will be in the `dist` folder.
